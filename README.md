# ðŸŽ‚ What I Learned: Using the `<progress>` HTML Element for Loading Indicators

**This document outlines what I've learned about using the `<progress>` HTML element to create visual loading indicators in web development.**

## Key Concepts

* **The `<progress>` Element:** The `<progress>` tag is an HTML5 element that displays the progress of a task. It's a semantic way to represent loading or the completion of a process.

* **`value` Attribute:** This attribute specifies how much of the task has been completed. Its value should be between 0 and the value of the `max` attribute. If the `value` attribute is not present, the progress bar is indeterminate (it shows activity without indicating how much has been done).

* **`max` Attribute:** This attribute specifies the total amount of work the task requires. The default value is 1.

* **Indeterminate Progress Bars:** When the `value` attribute is not set, the browser typically displays a looping animation to indicate that a process is ongoing, but without a specific completion percentage. This is useful when you don't know how long a task will take.
